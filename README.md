## What's this?

This is a real-time chat client, of which the original prototype was made in just one day, as part of SALT's (School of Applied Technology, Stockholm) HackDay - a special event during the boot camp, where we were tasked with building a complete full-stack application of our choice in one day.

In this app you can:
* chat with other users in real-  time
* get a random cute animal avatar
* create different channels
* see notifications of new messages
* be greeted by a bot if you are the only user
